This code runs from the
command line.

For some reason, the code
chops off the first three lines
of the first weather report, but the
subsequent weather reports are
OK. 

Winter Cold!, Massive Rain!, etc., are
listed at the end of the weather reports
as necessary.

Also, there is an error in the slack
api: I imported all the modules
necessary, but SLack still returned
an error message. # Still getting error 
message on line: client =  WebClient(token=SLACK_API_TOKEN)
getting error msg on WebClient
Kept in file to show you how far I was in 
that portion of the project.
